This is a webpage to display data from an esp32 using ble (bluetooth low energy).
It builds off of Random Nerd Tutorials'
[ESP32 Web Bluetooth (BLE): Getting Started Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-bluetooth/)
by adding additional characteristics.
It is part of my teams Senior Design Project in which we are building two
street signs for single-lane roadside construction that communicate which each other much like
traffic flaggers.
